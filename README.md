# Hello, Bedrock!

This is the code project for the [Hello, Bedrock!](https://davidpallmann.hashnode.dev/hello-bedrock) blog post. 

This episode: Amazon API Gateway. In this Hello, Cloud blog series, we're covering the basics of AWS cloud services for newcomers who are .NET developers. If you love C# but are new to AWS, or to this particular service, this should give you a jumpstart.

In this post we'll introduce Amazon Bedrock and use it in a "Hello, Cloud" .NET program to generate text. We'll do this step-by-step, making no assumptions other than familiarity with C# and Visual Studio. We're using Visual Studio 2022 and .NET 6.

## Our Hello, Bedrock Project

We will first get familiar with Bedrock in the AWS console, focusing on text generation. Then we'll write a .NET program that responds to text prompts with a choice of model. We won't be customizing any models in this tutorial and will rely on what the models give us out-of-the-box.

See the blog post for the tutorial to create this project and run it on AWS.
